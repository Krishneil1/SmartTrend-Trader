- **RSI Filter:** Avoids overbought and oversold market conditions, increasing the probability of successful trades.
- **Higher Timeframe Confirmation:** Incorporates an EMA from a higher timeframe to ensure alignment with broader trends.
- **Volume and Session Filters:** Further validates trades based on volume conditions and restricts trades to specified sessions for increased reliability.
